# AED-Project-Homeless-Helpers

## Problem Statement:
On a single night, more than half a million Americans go homeless, which represents 0.2% of the US population.
The connection between housing and homelessness is generally intuitive, but the strong link between health and homelessness is often overlooked.
Living on the street or in crowded homeless shelters is extremely stressful and made worse by being exposed to communicable disease 
(e.g. TB, respiratory illnesses, flu, hepatitis, etc.), violence, malnutrition,and harmful weather exposure.
We need a system which can help homeless people get proper health care facilities.

## Solution:
Homeless Helpers is an application that helps homeless people to get better healthcasre facilities by diminishing the gap between homeless people and hospitals.
Homeless people can get their treatment done in nearby hospital by only paying the amount they can afford.
This application is expected to reduce the health issues faced by homeless people and help in minimizing the health risks.


## Approach:

First,the homeless person registers with us and adds any medical history he has. After successful registration hospital is allocated to the person.
To detect the issue more precisely department is allocated. On the basis of department selected for a particular person symptoms are detected 
and covid test is done.
If the covid test is positive, person  is denied the entry to the hospital.
If the covid test is negative, proper disease analysis is done to find the medical issue faced by the person.
After successful diagnosis of disease and allocation of hospital Health report of the person is generated.
